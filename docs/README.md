My notes on various things

The majority of my notes are for Debian based distros.

## :framed_picture: Background

When setting up a project or system, such as a git repoistory or GNU/Linux or Windows computer, I need to reference solutions to problems that I
have solved in the past and so this repository is my notes to myself. All I need to do is go to this site and search for something that I have
done in the past.

I know that [Obsidian][1] exists as a mind map of ideas, but I don't like the fact that the free version is strictly local and not web bassed.
Since I am device agnostic and could be working off of a Windows system, GNU/Linux, Mac (rarely), or mobile somewhere, I prefer that my
notes be in the cloud. Hosting my notes on GitHub and publishing them to an [`mkdocs-material`][2] site allows me to access them from
anywhere as well as share my notes with the world in hopes that they help someone else.

The notes are broken up by a topic per page but sometimes can be found in other areas of site. I don't spend a whole lot of time giving
background nor organizing the notes and so it may be a little difficult to interpret my chicken scratch.
