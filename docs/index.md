:pencil: My notes on various things. :pushpin:

The majority of my notes are for Debian based distros.

Also, take a look at my [dotfiles repo][5].

## :pushpin: TL;DR

- git gpg build-essential
- brew
- lpass
- ssh
- gpg
- gh
- docker

## :frame_with_picture: Background

When setting up a project or system, such as a git repoistory or GNU/Linux or Windows computer, I need to reference solutions to problems that I
have solved in the past and so this repository is my notes to myself. All I need to do is go to this site and search for something that I have
done in the past.

I know that [Obsidian][1] exists as a mind map of ideas, but I don't like the fact that the free version is strictly local and not web bassed.
Since I am device agnostic and could be working off of a Windows system, GNU/Linux, Mac (rarely), or mobile somewhere, I prefer that my
notes be in the cloud. Hosting my notes on GitHub and publishing them to an [`mkdocs-material`][2] site allows me to access them from
anywhere as well as share my notes with the world in hopes that they help someone else.


!!! warning

    The notes are broken up by a topic per page but sometimes can be found in other areas of site. I don't spend a whole lot of time giving
    background nor organizing the notes and so it may be a little difficult to interpret my chicken scratch.
